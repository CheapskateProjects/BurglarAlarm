# BurglarAlarm
This project consists of ESP8266 alarm control and Arduino sensor board.

ESP8266 provides a web page that can be used through WLAN authentication to arm or disarm the alarm device.

Arduino provides sensor board which is enabled or disabled by ESP8266. If Arduino board is enabled it alarms with a siren if any of the sensors is triggered.
